# Netflix-Web
Creating a simple homepage similar to Netflix involves designing a visually appealing layout that showcases featured content, such as movies and TV shows, using HTML and CSS. The homepage typically includes a prominent header with the Netflix logo, a navigation menu, and a hero section displaying a large banner image for a featured title. Below this, a grid or carousel format can be used to present various categories of content, such as "Trending Now" or "Popular on Netflix," allowing users to easily browse through thumbnails of available titles. CSS is used to style the elements, ensuring a modern, sleek look with responsive design for different screen sizes, providing an engaging user experience reminiscent of the actual Netflix platform.
